# Naive Bayes Classifier of Major League Baseball Prospects
 First attempt at exploring Bayesian Analysis, used as a project for a Probability and Statistics course @ DU. I used a Naive Bayes Classifier to help determine the probability of a player making it to the Major Leagues, using data from minor league performances after players' first year in a minor league farm system. There are some flaws in the modelling, which I intend on revisiting once I've completed the Advanced Probability and Statistics course that I am currently enrolled in.

## The Data
First and foremost, I owe a data courtesy to several institutions/individuals:

- Baseball Almanac - I used this site to pull tables of draftee information

- Michael Lee (https://www.mikelee.co/projects/) - Michael created a very wonderful script that makes it very easy to spider through tables of stats sites to pull data on players in the Minor League system–a relatively difficult task compared to finding data on major league players

- Baseball-Reference - THE institution for anything on baseball stats. Most of the data was collected from their tables.

- Lahman’s Baseball Archive - A very popular dataset for basic baseball analysis. There’s even a very useful package for R that I did not use.

## Files
- The primary file of interest is the EVasquezVilla_FinalPaper.pdf. The rmd file includes all code used for the analysis. data.rmd includes a webscraping file created by Michael Lee, which is mentioned in the data courtesies.
